## Minesweeper, written from scratch in  Python
This classic logic puzzle game was developed by a small team of four students at Texas A&M University as a proof of concept. Rebuilding the well-known game of Minesweeper from the ground-up using Python and SDL was a learning experience and allowed the students to express their creativity with the Python language.

If you want to build off of this version of Minesweeper, please feel free to fork the official Github. This project is available under an GPL v3 open-source license. Thank you.
